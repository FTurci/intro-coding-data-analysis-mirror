    "Element-wise operations in numpy allow you to perform arithmetic or mathematical functions on each corresponding element of arrays. For example, if you have two arrays of the same length, `arr1` and `arr2`, you can add them directly: `arr1 + arr2`. This will produce a new array where each element is the sum of the elements at the same position in the original arrays. Similarly, you can use other operators (`-`, `*`, `/`) or numpy functions (`np.sqrt(arr1)`, `np.cos(arr1)`) to apply operations to each element individually. The arrays must have compatible shapes for these operations."

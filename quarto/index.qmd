## Welcome to the Course

This is the course material for **Introduction to coding and data analysis**, SCIF10002.

## How to use

- You will find the more theoretical introduction under **Lesson**
- The hands-on exercises will be under **Exercises**
- Over the course of the weeks the solutions will be released under **Solutions**
- Regularly, interactive **formative tests** will be released under **Formative tests**

**Important.** You can use the search button ðŸ”Ž to search across all the pages and skim through the course.

**Note.** Many of the following pages also allow you to interact with the code by running Python snippets inside your browser. It is useful 
- As a fallback option if *Noteable* is unreachable.
- For the regularly released *formative tests*.

The content in this website mirrors the interactive notebooks released on **Noteable**.

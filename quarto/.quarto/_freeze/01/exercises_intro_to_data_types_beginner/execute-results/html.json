This notebook is designed for students who are just starting out with the Python programming language.  \n\nYour task today is to read through the material carefully and complete the exercises provided at the end. These exercises are an important part of the learning process and will help you check your understanding.  \n\n> **Important:** You have three options for today’s work:  [`Beginner`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_beginner.qmd), [`Intermediate`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.qmd), or [`Advanced`](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_advanced.qmd). If you are new to Python, please choose this *Beginner* notebook. You will have plenty of opportunities later in the course to explore the other levels.  \n\nIn this notebook, you will be introduced to the *numeric*, *boolean*, and *string* Python data types. Gaining experience with these data types is essential, as they form the foundation for everything else you will learn in Python.  \n\nBe sure to work through the examples and attempt all the exercises. They are designed to reinforce your learning and build your confidence.  \n\n### Table of Contents\n\n - [Welcome Page](./week_01_home.qmd)\n - [**Beginner: Basic Data Types**](#Basic-Data-Types)\n     - [What are Data Types?](#What-are-Data-Types?)\n     - [Integers and floats](#Integers-and-floats)\n     - [Strings](#Strings)\n     - [Booleans](#Booleans)\n     - [Casting Between Data Types](#Casting-Between-Data-Types)\n     - [Exercises](#Exercises)\n - [Intermediate: Collections](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.qmd)\n - [Advanced: Copying and References](./week_01_intro_to_data_types_advanced.qmd)\n - [Slides](./week_01_slides.qmd) ([Powerpoint](./Lecture1_Introduction_And_Data_Types.pptx))\n\n## What are Data Types?\n\nWriting code is a lot like writing a recipe for cooking. When writing a recipe, you might first list some ingredients, then give a careful sequence of steps, with the end result being some tasty and (hopefully!) digestible baked goods. Coding works the same way; we start with some inputs (the ingredients), ask the computer to perform a series of steps and produce some easy-to-digest result (the outputs).\n\nIn the same way that ingredients can be referred to as **objects** in the real-world, we refer to the data we use in coding as **objects** too. \n\n\nFurthermore, when cooking we might refer to objects by *types of food*. For instance, we may want to use 2 apples and an orange in a recipe, as opposed to 3 generic \"food-objects\". Similarly, when coding we refer to *types of data*, or **data types**. \n\n## Basic Data Types\n\n\nIn Python there are many different data types with some of the most commonly used built-in data types being:\n\n - integer and floating point scalars\n - boolean values\n - strings\n - tuples\n - lists\n - sets\n - dictionaries\n\n\n > **Note:** This list is by no means comprehensive. Other data types are also supported through common packages (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `...`) and it is even possible to make your own custom datatypes! For now we will just focus on the built-in datatypes. However, packages such as `numpy` and `pandas` will be explored in later notebooks.\n\nThe \"type\" of a variable can be found using the `type()` function in python. Try changing and running the below code to see how this function is used. \n\n::: {#86ad023d .cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 1\nb = 1.1e-6\nc = True\nd = 'word'\ne = (2,3)\nf = [1, 2, 3]\ng = {'key1' : '9', 'key2': 20}\n\ntype(a)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\nint\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn the above code, `a`, `b`, ..., `g` are variables. A variable is a named reference to a piece of data, created using the = (assignment) operator. The *type of a variable* describes the kind of data it stores. For example, `a` stores an integer (a whole number), so its type is `int`.\n\n > **Note:** Python allows for scientific notation for floats (decimal numbers). For example, in the above code `1.1e-6` means `1.1` times `10` to the minus `6`.\n\nValues of variables can also be displayed with the `print()` function. If given many arguments, the print statement will print all of them. Try this below:\n\n::: {#586f6a82 .cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 0.01\nb = 'strrring'\nc = [1,2,3]\n\nprint(a)\nprint(a,b,c)\nprint(a,c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n0.01\n0.01 strrring [1, 2, 3]\n0.01 [1, 2, 3]\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBy default, a Jupyter notebook will treat the last line of a code box as a print statement if it can.\n\n::: {#0507a677 .cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Here is some arbitrary code\nd = 'another string'\n\n# The below line will print a, as it is the last line in this box\na\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}\n```\n0.01\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Integers and floats\n\nWhen first getting to grips with python, you can think of integers as \"whole numbers\" and floats as \"numbers including decimals\". Integers are represented with the `int` datatype and floats are represented with the `float` datatype. Basic mathematical operations are available for `int` types and `float` types. Try a few below:\n\n > **Warning:** A common mistake made by new users of Python is to use `^` for exponentiation (e.g. $2^5$). In fact, in Python `^` represents the logical `XOR` operator and the `**` operator represents exponentiation. By performing your own research online, see if you can work out what the `XOR` function is doing here.\n\n::: {#3dc90875 .cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 3\nb = 2\n\n# Addition\nprint(a+b)\n\n# Subtraction\nprint(a-b)\n\n# Multiplication\nprint(a*b)\n\n# Exponentiation\nprint(a**b)\n\n# NOT EXPONENTIATION - ACTUALLY XOR\nprint(a^b)\n\n# Division\nprint(a/b)\n\n# Integer division (i.e. division with rounding down)\nprint(a//b)\n\n# Modulo\nprint(a % b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n5\n1\n6\n9\n1\n1.5\n1\n1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can combine operations using round brackets, `(` and `)`, much in the same way you would in everyday math. For example:\n\n::: {#cee009e8 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint((a+b)/(b**2)+1/(3*a))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1.3611111111111112\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOften, you may hear it mentioned that Python allows for *arbitrary precision* integers. This means that Python can accurately manipulate very large numbers stored as `int`s. For example;\n\n::: {#92f7e20f .cell execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 174129409583938905209834890385935802\nb = 417873297348327895798237589723987598\n\n# Both a and b are ints\nprint(type(a))\nprint(type(b))\n\n# You can check for yourself that this is correct!\nprint(a+b)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'int'>\n<class 'int'>\n592002706932266801008072480109923400\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n > **Warning:** Although `int`s can store arbitrary precision whole numbers in Python, `float`s cannot!! Failure to realize this can result in all sorts of strange errors. For example, consider the below;\n\n::: {#59b723a3 .cell execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Very big float\na = 1e30\n\n# Lets have a look at `a`\nprint(a)\nprint(type(a))\n\n# Now let's round `a` to the nearest whole number... this shouldn't change `a`... right?\nb = round(a)\n\n# Wrong... try repeating the above but with `a` as an integer (i.e. change the first line to `a=1000...00`)\nprint(b)\nprint(type(b))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1e+30\n<class 'float'>\n1000000000000000019884624838656\n<class 'int'>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> **Check your understanding:** What’s the difference between `/` and `//`? Why might `3 * 0.1` not equal `0.3` exactly in Python?\n\n## Strings\n\n\nIn this section we are going to look more at strings. \n\nA string is a finite sequence of characters (e.g., letters, numbers, symbols and punctuation marks). In python, strings can be specified with either double of single quotes like so:\n\n::: {#098e417e .cell execution_count=9}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nstring1 = 'This is a string'\nstring2 = \"This is also a string\"\nstring3 = \"\"\nstring4 = 'string3 is also a string!'\n\nprint(string1)\nprint(string2)\nprint(string3)\nprint(string4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis is a string\nThis is also a string\n\nstring3 is also a string!\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAn important characteristic of each string is its length, which is the number of characters in it. The length can be any natural number (i.e., zero or any positive integer). In python we can see the length of a string by using the `len()` function. In fact, this function can be used to assess the length of many different variable types such as lists, tuples, sets and so on (more on those later).\n\n::: {#fdb5e16d .cell execution_count=10}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nstring1 = 'loooooong string'\nstring2 = 'shor'\nstring3 = ''\n\n\nprint(len(string1))\nprint(len(string2))\nprint(len(string3))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n16\n4\n0\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n > **Brief interlude:** In Python, you can add comments to your code using the `#` symbol. Comments are lines of text that are ignored when the code runs, but they play an important role in explaining what your code is doing. Writing clear and meaningful comments as you code is considered best practice. It helps others (and your future self) understand your logic and what you are trying to do. Below is a simple example that shows how to use comments in Python. Make sure you are comfortable with this, as commenting is a crucial habit for anyone working with code.\n\n::: {#b228f1b1 .cell execution_count=11}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# The below line prints a string, this line is a comment\nprint('This statement is printed') # This is another comment\n\n# The below line is not a comment as the # is contained within quotes\ntext = \"# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.\"\nprint(text)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThis statement is printed\n# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes.\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n> **Check your understanding:** What is the difference between `print(2 + 3)` and `print(\"2\" + \"3\")`? What happens if you try `x = \"hello\" + 5`? Using the below box, write some code to answer these questions.\n\n::: {#8005013f .cell execution_count=12}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Write your code here...\n```\n:::\n\n\n### String manipulation\n\nPython has many useful tools for manipulating strings. One such function is the `format` function, which allows you to insert variables of different types into strings. Note that `x` in the below example does not need to be a string.\n\n::: {#7179428a .cell execution_count=13}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 8\ny = 'John'\ns = \"{} is {} feet tall\".format(y, x)\nprint(s)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nJohn is 8 feet tall\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother useful tool is the concatenation operater; `+`. Concatenation in programming is another way for saying \"join together\". See the below for an example of how this is done.\n\n::: {#d872fe90 .cell execution_count=14}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 'string1'\nb = 'string2'\nc = a + ' ' + b\n\nprint(c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nstring1 string2\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nIn fact, the previous example could be done using concatenation instead of the `format` funtion. Note though that we must be careful and convert `x` from an integer to a string, using `str()`, in this case.\n\n::: {#d810041d .cell execution_count=15}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 8\ny = 'John'\n\nprint(y + ' is ' + str(x) + ' feet tall')\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nJohn is 8 feet tall\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOther useful functions for string manipulation include\n\n - `strip`; which, by default, removes any white space from the beginning and end of a string. However, you can also specify which characters you wish to remove.\n \n - `split`; splits a string by specified character (known as a seperator), and returns a list. By default, the separator is a space and this function splits a sentence into individual words.\n \n - `replace`; this returns a string with some specified value replaced with another specified value.\n \n - `upper`; this makes a string all uppercase.\n \n - `lower`; this makes a string all lowercase.\n \nSeveral examples are given below. Please make sure you understand what each of these functions does before moving on to the next section. There are many other functions available and a good resource for learning about each individual function and trying them for yourself is the [w3 schools python reference site](https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_string.asp).\n\n::: {#28eb1cba .cell execution_count=16}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Demonstration of the strip function\nprint(\"Demonstration of strip function\\n\")\n\n\nx = '    this is a string     '\nprint(x)\nprint(x.strip())\ny = '...another string...'\nprint(y)\nprint(y.strip('.'))\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Demonstration of the split function\nprint(\"\\nDemonstration of split function\\n\")\n\n\nx = 'This is a string'\nprint(x)\nprint(x.split())\nprint(x.split('i'))\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Demonstration of the replace function\nprint(\"\\nDemonstration of replace function\\n\")\n\nx = 'I am not sure that I understand how the replace function works'\nprint(x)\ny = x.replace('am not sure', 'am totally sure')\nprint(y)\nz = y.replace('sure', 'sure, 100% sure in fact thanks to this (rather well put together) notebook,')\nprint(z)\n\n# -------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Demonstration of the upper and lower functions\nprint(\"\\nDemonstration of upper and lower functions\\n\")\n\nx = 'RaNDom CAseS'\nprint(x)\nprint(x.lower())\nprint(x.upper())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nDemonstration of strip function\n\n    this is a string     \nthis is a string\n...another string...\nanother string\n\nDemonstration of split function\n\nThis is a string\n['This', 'is', 'a', 'string']\n['Th', 's ', 's a str', 'ng']\n\nDemonstration of replace function\n\nI am not sure that I understand how the replace function works\nI am totally sure that I understand how the replace function works\nI am totally sure, 100% sure in fact thanks to this (rather well put together) notebook, that I understand how the replace function works\n\nDemonstration of upper and lower functions\n\nRaNDom CAseS\nrandom cases\nRANDOM CASES\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Booleans\n\nA boolean in python is a variable that can be either `True` or `False`. For instance:\n\n::: {#a95d6406 .cell execution_count=17}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Create a boolean variable \nmy_boolean = True\nprint(my_boolean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBooleans arise in all sorts of situations. For example, consider the below code:\n\n::: {#eaa597db .cell execution_count=18}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nprint(128 > 100)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou should see it print `True`, which makes sense as `128` is indeed larger than `100`. Try changing the numbers above; can you make this print `False`?\n\nIn this code, the expression `128 > 100` is a boolean statement. We can make this clearer like so:\n\n::: {#5a9a0ec4 .cell execution_count=19}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nmy_boolean = 128 > 100\nprint(my_boolean)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nTrue\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe above code is identical to the previous, but we have now saved the `True/False` value as `my_boolean`.\n\nSome common boolean operators include: \n\n - `not`: This negates the value of a variable (i.e. turns `True` to `False` and `False` to `True`).\n - `and`: This is a logical `and`.\n - `or`: This is a logical `or`.\n - `is`: This checks whether two variables point to the same object in memory.\n - `==`: This checks whether two variables are equal in value (Note: This shouldn't be confused for the assigment operator; `=`).\n - `!=`: This checks whether two variables are not equal in value.\n \nBoolean operators in Python are designed to be intuitive and as close to natural language as possible. The below code demonstrates how the boolean operations `and`, `or`, `==` and `!=` and `not` are used. Try changing the values of `a` and `b` to ensure you understand how these operations work.\n\n::: {#ffb441b0 .cell execution_count=20}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = True\nb = False\n\nprint(\"not a: \", not a)\nprint(\"a and b: \", a and b)\nprint(\"a or b: \", a or b)\nprint(\"a==b: \", a==b)\nprint(\"a!=b: \", a!=b)\n\n# Note: both c and b are treated as False, but they are not equal, see below;\nc = {}\nprint(\"not c: \", not c)\nprint(\"not b: \", not b)\nprint(\"b==c: \", b==c)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nnot a:  False\na and b:  False\na or b:  True\na==b:  False\na!=b:  True\nnot c:  True\nnot b:  True\nb==c:  False\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOther common relational expressions which give `True/False` output include `<=`, `>=`, `<` and `>` for numeric datatypes (e.g. `int`s and `float`s) and `in` for collection datatypes (such as `list`s or `tuple`s, which we shall look at next). \n\n::: {#67f1b658 .cell execution_count=21}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 1\nb = 1.1\n\nprint(\"a>b:    \", a>b)\nprint(\"a<b:    \", a<b)\nprint(\"a>=b:   \", a>=b)\nprint(\"a<=b:   \", a<=b)\n\nc = \"Some string\"\nd = \"om\"\nprint(\"c in d: \", c in d)\nprint(\"d in c: \", d in c)\n\ne = 1\nf = 0.1\ng = [1,2,3]\nprint(\"e in g: \", e in g)\nprint(\"f in g: \", f in g)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\na>b:     False\na<b:     True\na>=b:    False\na<=b:    True\nc in d:  False\nd in c:  True\ne in g:  True\nf in g:  False\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Casting Between Data Types\n\nIn Python the data type of a variable is dynamic. This means that you do not need to specify the data type beforehand and that it can easily be changed. For example, try moving the type statement before and after the sum in the below block and see how the output is changed. Why does the output change?\n\n::: {#a2fbb19c .cell execution_count=22}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\na = 1\nb = 1.1\n\nprint(type(a))\n\na = a+b\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n<class 'int'>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSeveral inbuilt functions are available for converting between types. The most commonly used of these are the `int`, `float` and `str` functions. Try these out below. **Caution**: Note how converting `z` back to a float does not give the original value `x`. Why do you think this is?\n\n::: {#d5ae8413 .cell execution_count=23}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 1.1\ny = str(x)\nz = int(x)\n\nprint(x)\nprint(y)\nprint(z)\n\nprint(type(x))\nprint(type(y))\nprint(type(z))\n\nprint(x - float(z))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n1.1\n1.1\n1\n<class 'float'>\n<class 'str'>\n<class 'int'>\n0.10000000000000009\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe act of converting one data type to another is often referred to as **casting**. For instance, in the above code, we *cast* `x` from a `float` to a `string` and then from a `string` to an `integer`.\n\n > **Check your Understanding:** What happens if you try `int(\"10.5\")`? Why might you convert a number to a string using `str()`? Use the below code box to answer these questions.\n\n::: {#2092a081 .cell execution_count=24}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Write your answers here...\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Exercises\n\n**Question 1:** Below are three variables `x`, `y` and `z`. By using the operators introduced in the `Booleans` section of this notebook, construct a boolean variable, `my_boolean` which is true if and only if $y$ lies strictly between $x^2$ and $z^3$. That is, `my_boolean` should be true if and only if either $x^2<y<z^3$ or $z^3<y<x^2$.\n\n::: {#42787117 .cell execution_count=25}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Variables x, y and z\nx = 1\ny = 2\nz = 1.26\n\nmy_boolean = # Write your code here...\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-error}\n\n::: {.ansi-escaped-output}\n```{=html}\n<pre>  <span class=\"ansi-cyan-fg\">Cell</span><span class=\"ansi-cyan-fg\"> </span><span class=\"ansi-green-fg\">In[24]</span><span class=\"ansi-green-fg\">, line 6</span>\n<span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">    </span><span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">my_boolean = # Write your code here...</span>\n                 ^\n<span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">SyntaxError</span><span class=\"ansi-red-fg\">:</span> invalid syntax\n</pre>\n```\n:::\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n**Question 2:** In the below code, we have two boolean variables; `is_raining` and `have_umbrella`.

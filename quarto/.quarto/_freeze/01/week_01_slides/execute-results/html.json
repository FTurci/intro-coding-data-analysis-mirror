In this module, we shall be learning to code in Python\n - Python is a programming language\n\n<img src=\"./images/python.png\" alt=\"Welcome page for the unit on Blackboard\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:20%\"/>\n\n\n - In the same way humans communicate using different languages, there are many languages we can use to communicate with a computer\n\n - Python is particularly useful for:\n\n   - Analysing data\n   - Making plots and visualisations\n   - Running simulations\n   - Machine learning and AI\n\n::: {#207dead9 .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ndef greet(name):\n    \"\"\"Return a friendly greeting.\"\"\"\n    return f\"Hello, {name}!\"\n\ngreet(\"Bob\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```\n'Hello, Bob!'\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Learning to Code\n\n\n - In fact, learning to code is a lot like learning a language\n\n - When learning French, you might:\n\n   - Learn many phrases\n   - Practice writing sentences\n   - Speak to people who know the language\n - You can't learn a language by listening to other people describe it…\n - Hands-on experience and regular practice are **crucial!**\n\n\n\n## Getting Started\n\n - So… what actually is coding?\n - You can think of writing code as like writing a recipe…\n   - You might start by specifying some ingredients…\n   - Then list some instructions…\n   - To get a desired output\n - Coding is pretty similar\n \n \n<img src=\"./images/recipe.png\" alt=\"Welcome page for the unit on Blackboard\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:20%\"/>\n\n## Getting Started\n\n - You might start by specifying some **inputs**…\n - Then list some **instructions**…\n - To get a desired **output**\n\n::: {#3ac076aa .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Start with two ingredients (inputs)\nx = 7\ny = 4\n\n# Step 1: Add them together\nstep1 = x + y\n\n# Step 2: Multiply the result by 2\nstep2 = step1 * 2\n\n# Step 3: Subtract y from that\nz = step2 - y\n\n# Final output\nprint(\"The final result is:\", z)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nThe final result is: 18\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nHere we are producing some output that might be difficult to  compute or evaluate by hand.\n\n## Assigning Variables\n\n::: {#43869b78 .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 7\ny = 4\n```\n:::\n\n\n - In this code, `x` and `y` are variables \n - These are named pieces of data which we can use for future computations\n - The `=` symbol is the assignment operator.\n   - Unlike in maths, this is an instruction\n   - E.g. `x=7` means \"Save the integer 7 under the variable name x\"\n\n## Data Types\n\n::: {#f9c0ef0f .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nx = 7        # an integer\ny = \"hello\"  # a string of text\nz = True     # a boolean (true/false)\n```\n:::\n\n\n - When writing the recipe, some foods were of the “same type”\n   - E.g. we had 2 eggs\n\n - In the same way, in coding we have different types of data\n\n - Today, we shall look at some of these\n - Understanding data types is important, as we want to use different data types for different tasks\n\n## Numeric Data Types\n\n::: {#ef6bb3a6 .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Start with an integer and a float\nx = 7 # integer\ny = 3.5 # float (decimal number)\n\n# Convert integer to float\nx_as_float = float(x)\n\n# Convert float to integer\ny_as_int = int(y)\n```\n:::\n\n\n - The most ubiquitous data types are numeric \n   - Integers: Whole numbers/Integers\n   - ℤ = {…, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,… }\n\n - Floats: Decimal numbers\n   - ℝ = Real numbers\n   - We can convert between float's and integers using the `float` and `int` functions.\n\n - What do you think might happen if we convert `y` to an integer?\n \n**Warning:** A computer cannot actually describe arbitrarily small and large numbers – it approximates instead\n\n## Strings\n\n - A string is a sequence of characters. Strings can contain: \n   - Letters\n   - Numbers (treated as characters)\n   - Punctuation\n   - Spaces\n   - Combinations of the above\n   - Nothing at all\n\n::: {#9aacf0e0 .cell execution_count=6}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# Letters\nletters = \"Hello\"\n\n# Numbers (treated as characters)\nnumbers = \"12345\"\n\n# Punctuation\npunctuation = \"!?.,;;\"\n\n# Spaces\nspaces = \"   \" # three spaces\n\n# Combinations of the above\ncombo = \"Hi123?! \"\n\n# Nothing at all (an empty string)\nempty = \"\"\n```\n:::\n\n\n - In practice, there are many things we may want to do with text in Python\n   - Split it into sentences\n   - Search through it\n   - Replace words\n   \nAfter todays practical you will be able to perform some of these operations!\n\n## Booleans\n\n - A Boolean is  variable that can be either `True` or `False`\n - Booleans represent logical statements. \n - For instance, we might think of:\n\n   - `cat_is_black` as representing the sentence \"The cat is black\"\n   - `cat_has_four_legs` as representing the sentence \"The cat has four legs\"\n - We can use logical operators to combine Boolean statements\n   - `cat_is_black and cat_has_four_legs` represents the sentence \"The cat is black and has four legs\"\n\n::: {#1511768b .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=7}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ncat_is_black = True\ncat_has_four_legs = False\nprint(cat_is_black and cat_has_four_legs)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nFalse\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Booleans\n\n\n<img src=\"./images/truth_table.png\" alt=\"Welcome page for the unit on Blackboard\" style=\"display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;width:60%\"/>\n\n## Collections\n\n - We've now seen some simple examples of datatypes:\n   - Numeric, strings, and booleans.\n - Data types don’t always have to be this simple!\n   - Sometimes we need data types that can hold more complex information.\n - We'll see more examples throughout the course but for now we'll provide just one\n - A collection is any in-built data type that can group multiple objects together.\n - The most common collection is a list: an ordered group of items.\n   - Lists let you store, organize, and work with many values at once.\n\n::: {#60ae929c .cell quarto-private-1='{\"key\":\"slideshow\",\"value\":{\"slide_type\":\"fragment\"}}' execution_count=8}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n# A list of numbers\nscores = [10, 15, 20]\n\n# A List of strings\nshopping = [\"milk\", \"bread\", \"eggs\", \"cheese\"]\n\n# A mixed list (different data types together)\nmixed = [42, \"hello\"]\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Practical\n\n - We have students from a range of courses and backgrounds in this class\n   - Chemistry\n   - Physics\n   - Data Science\n - Some people in the room will have less experience than others\n - For the first few weeks, we shall try to account for the differences in ability where possible\n\n## Practical\n\n - We now move over to Python\n - Please open [week_01_home.ipynb](./week_01_home.qmd)\n - For the rest of today, you must work through a Python notebook\n - You have a choice of one of three options\n   - [Option 1: Beginner - Basic Data Types](week_01_intro_to_data_types_beginner.qmd)\n   - [Option 2: Intermediate - Collections](week_01_intro_to_data_types_intermediate.qmd)\n   - [Option 3: Advanced - Copying and References](week_01_intro_to_data_types_advanced.qmd)\n\n",
